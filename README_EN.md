CatTuber users can combine parts from the demonstration model (such as head, hand, body, tail, etc.) into their own models and use the resulting models for their own commercial purposes under the following conditions:

* The model produced does not violate local laws and regulations;
* This model can only be used in CatTuber unless permitted;
* In the case of making models for others, clearly inform the other party that there are parts that are reused in the model and  can only be used in CatTuber;

## Model contribution
In the short term, CatTuber does not have Steam Workshop. If you have a model you want to share with others in CatTuber, please contact zh4017@foxmail.com.

Note: There will be certain quality requirements, and you need to own the rights to the model (you can use the parts of the model model in this repository, but please ensure that your model figure is original or has the permission of the model figure owner).
